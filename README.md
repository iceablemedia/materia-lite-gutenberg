# Materia Lite Gutenberg
This is a fork of [Materia lite 1.0.9](https://github.com/iceablemedia/materia-lite) with experimental support for [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

This is a personal sandbox project to experiment with features support, editor styles, templates and custom blocks for Gutenberg. Do not use on live on production sites (or at your own risks).

Gutenberg specific functions, features support and and assets are in the /inc/gutenberg/ folder.

The (quickly-made) first iteration is very basic, but should be just enough so I can use it during a live demo of Gutenberg to demonstrate that:
* "Themes can add their own editor style to make it more WYSIWYG"  
* "Themes can replace the color palettes with their own"  
* "Themes and plugins can create pre-made templates with placeholder blocks"  

## TODO

* Complete Gutenberg editor styles  
* Experiment with custom block(s)  

## CHANGELOG
